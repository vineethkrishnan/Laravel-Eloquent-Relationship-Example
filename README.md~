Laravel-Eloquent-Relationship-Example
=====================================

Really stupid laravel eloquent example for relationship with three models and one field, with same field name (Actually this was created for some other bug testing purpose)

Steps to test
-------------------------
1 - Download the repository
2 - Set the db config & run the migration 'php artisan migrate'
3 - Seed the database 'php artisan db:seed'
4 - Start the development server 'php arisan serve'
5 - Access the server 'http://localhost:8000'

You will be able to see a table which was created using laravel eloquent relationships, see the models to understand the relationships
